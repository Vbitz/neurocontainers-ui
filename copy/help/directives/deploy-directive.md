# DEPLOY Directive

The DEPLOY directive configures deployment settings for the container, including paths and binaries.

## Paths

- Specify directories to include in deployment
- Use absolute paths for clarity
- Example: `/app/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`

## Binaries

- List specific executable files to deploy
- Binary names or full paths
- Example: `myapp`, `processingTool`
