# Target Architectures

Choose the processor architectures your container should support:

**x86_64 (Intel/AMD):** Most common architecture
- Desktop computers, most laptops
- Most cloud instances (AWS EC2, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Traditional servers and workstations

**aarch64 (ARM 64-bit):** Growing in popularity
- Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3)
- AWS Graviton instances
- Raspberry Pi 4+ and other ARM devices

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Select both for maximum compatibility, or just x86_64 if you're unsure.
