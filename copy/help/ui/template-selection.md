# Choose a Template

**Choose the most specific template for your needs.** More specific templates (like Python Package or R Package) provide better defaults, validation, and guided workflows, while general templates offer maximum flexibility. You can always customize any details after creation, so start with the most relevant template and adjust as needed.
