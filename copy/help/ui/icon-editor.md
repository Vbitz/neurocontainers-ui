# Container Icon

Upload a custom icon to help identify your container visually:

**Features:**
- Upload any image format (PNG, JPG, GIF, etc.)
- Images are automatically cropped to square and resized to 24Ã—24 pixels
- Default icons are generated from the first 1-2 letters of the container name
- Icons are embedded as base24 data in the YAML definition

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Icons help users visually identify containers in lists and interfaces.
