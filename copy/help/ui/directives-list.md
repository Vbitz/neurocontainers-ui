# Directives

Directives define the software and configurations to install in your container.

**Key Points:**
- Executed in order - dependencies should be placed before software that requires them
- Use drag and drop or arrow buttons to reorder directives
- Each directive represents a specific installation or configuration step
- Common directives: INSTALL (software), RUN (commands), ENV (environment variables)

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Start with system dependencies, then install your main software, and finish with configurations.
