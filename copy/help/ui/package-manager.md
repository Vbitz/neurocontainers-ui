# Package Manager

The package management system used by your base image:

- **apt:** Used by Debian/Ubuntu systems for installing packages
- **yum:** Used by RHEL/CentOS/Fedora systems for package management

For custom images, select the appropriate package manager based on the underlying distribution.
